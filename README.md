# QUIXML: Command-Line XML Editor
QUIXML is a command-line XML editor implemented in Java, designed to facilitate efficient editing and manipulation of XML documents directly from the terminal. It offers a range of features tailored for streamlined XML handling:

- **Command-Line Interface**: Built to operate seamlessly within terminal environments, enabling quick and efficient XML editing without the need for a graphical interface (yet).

- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Incorporates robust undo and redo capabilities (backtracking), allowing users to revert changes and navigate through document states effortlessly.

- **Templating Support**: Includes templating features to create and manage XML document structures, and in turn, the way in which the templating works makes the code *very* reusable, even for purposes other than this app.

- **Customizable Commands**: Pretty cool parsing action going on here, a single text file provides the link to the main functionalities the editor uses.

Most importantly, this is a personal project, where i learnt a *lot* about java and how design patterns help when the code gets big.
